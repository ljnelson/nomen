** Use Cases

*** Permit shared values
If someone has a name part of "Sr.", then there shouldn't be "sr",
"SR", "SR.", etc. in the Names repository/database.  The system
should make it possible to look these values up as someone is
entering them so they can pick one that already exists.

*** Allow unlimited types
A name value should be able to be assigned to a person under as many
types as that person wants.  For example, the value "Laird" should be
able to be designated my first name, my preferred salutation name, my
given name, and so forth.

*** Find a name value for a person by type
The system needs to be able to quickly provide the value for a name
owner's given name type.  The user should be able to ask the system
for the sort name or display name for all users in a speedy fashion.
