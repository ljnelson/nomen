* NameType
A NameType right now is just a glorified string--e.g. firstName.

In a real enterprise application, that's probably a bit simplistic.
For example, is a NameType of "firstName" shared by all people who
have Names indexed under it?  Or can a given person define his own
NameType as he wishes, and if it happens to be a duplicate, so what?

* NameValue
In an enterprise setting, NameValues must not have their values be
their primary keys.  That is, two NameValues with the same value must
nevertheless be treated as distinct, because if one person changes his
last name from Smith to Smyth, we don't want all people in the
application to have a similar change.
